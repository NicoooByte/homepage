                    For about seven years I have been studying and applying various programming languages academically,
                    privately
                    and professionally.
                    My skills include C# in combination with the game engine Unity or .NET, Python, JavaScript,
                    Typescript,
                    CSS, HTML and MySQL. Versioning systems like Git or SourceTree are also familiar to me. <br> <br>
                    In 2022 I graduated the HTBLUvA Salzburg with excellence (Advanced Diploma in Multimedia Arts).
                    There,
                    apart from my IT skills, I have been taught a skillset in the fields of human-centered design,
                    project planning and time management.<br> <br>
                    From August 2021 until September 2022 I got my first job, where my two colleagues and I built an
                    underground operations VR
                    simulator for the Austrian Armed Forces. In addition, I contributed to an application with which
                    tunnels, subway stations, etc. can be reconstructed as quickly as possible in a 3D environment. For
                    further information visit the following links

                        target="_blank">[2]</a>. <br> <br>

                    After that I fulfilled my compulsory social service at the Red Cross in Salzburg, which taught me
                    how to work effectivly under stress. Following these rather excrutiating nine months I decided to go
                    on a working holiday in Australia. While I was there I created and hosted a Website for
                    <a href="https://www.xeron-systems.at" target="_blank">Xeron Systems</a>
                    and created a small C# dynamic linked library which involved (legally) scrapping data.<br> <br>
                    Late February this year I started
                    being self-employed as a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) trainer specialising in
                    coding problems. The odds are high that your favorite LLM was partially trained by guys like me.
                    <br> <br> Now, I am looking for a stable job where I don't have to manage my taxes and insurance
                    (mostly because it is to expensive to be lucrative).
                    Privately, I have realized several paid and unpaid projects ranging from simple web scrapers and web
                    automations to Android reverse engineering, small ML models, a boids simulation and a port scanner.
                    Right now, I am diversifying my knowledge by reading books, most recently "Antifragility".
                    <br> <br>
                    I hope to have left a lasting impression and would like to hear back from you.
                    <br> <br>
                    Yours sincerely, <br> <br>
